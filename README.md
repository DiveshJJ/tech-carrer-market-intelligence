# 🚀 Tech Career Market Intelligence

## 📌 Overview
Tech Career Market Intelligence is an **end-to-end Data Engineering project** that analyzes real job market data to help users understand:
- Which tech roles are in demand  
- Which companies and locations are hiring  
- What skills are required for each role  

The project focuses on **data pipeline design, data quality, and analytics-ready outputs**, rather than UI or dashboards.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Job seekers often rely on:
- generic learning roadmaps  
- opinion-based advice  
- outdated or incomplete information  

There is no simple, data-backed way to answer questions such as:
- *Which tech domain has the most opportunities right now?*  
- *What skills should I learn for a specific role?*  
- *Are these skills actually in demand in the current job market?*  

This project solves that problem using **real job postings**, not assumptions.
